# A Postman collection for BtcTurk Crypto Exchange.

- Includes all Public and Private REST API endpoints.
- API_KEY and API_SECRET should be entered in the respective fields in "BtcTurk Live Environment" that comes with the collection.
- The authentication script is located in "REST Private" folder's "scripts" tab.
  (REST Private -> scripts -> pre-request script.)
- All endpoints are stored in the environment "BtcTurk Live Environment".

Note: Websocket authentication somehow consistenly fails due to how postman handles websocket requests, hence websocket enpoints are excluded.
